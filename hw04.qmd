## **Install Required Packages**

```{r}
# Required packages
if (!require(pacman))
  install.packages("pacman")

pacman::p_load(tidymodels,
               tidyverse,
               ranger,
               randomForest,
               glmnet,
               gridExtra)

# Global ggplot theme

```

Regression is a modeling technique for predicting quantitative-valued target attributes. The goals for this tutorial are as follows: 1. To provide examples of using different regression methods from the tidymodels package.

2. To demonstrate the problem of model overfitting due to correlated attributes in the data.

3. To illustrate how regularization can be used to avoid model overfitting.
